Everyone in the group is encouraged to take ownership of this project and make changes to the code or add issues and pull requests as they think of them.

Workflow notes: Issues are a place for ideas about what needs to be done. If you are going to work on an issue create a branch for the issue. When you are done working on the issue submit a pull request for your branch. After independent review your code will be merged to the project.
